                                    <p>Unsure who to pick for your XI? We've got you covered again! Now we will go through three of our picks in detail and also release our full XI for everyone to see! </p>

                                    <p><strong>Jamie Vardy (Leicester) - 11.2M </strong><br/>Leicester will aim to take another step towards confirming a top-four berth this season and this weekend and could even head into the international break in second if they beat Arsenal and Liverpool beat Manchester City on Sunday.  </p>

                                    <p>The Foxes are in confident mood at the moment, having won their last three in the league and five of their last six. Brendan Rodgers' side will host an underperforming Arsenal side on Saturday evening and will be disappointed if they don't win.  </p>

                                    <p>Arsenal have only won one of their last six matches in all competitions and have drawn their last four. The Gunners have only won two away games in all competitions this season and are there for the taking for Leicester, particuarly with Jamie Vardy in red hot form. </p>


                                    <p>The 32-year-old is the top scorer in the Premier League this season (10 goals) and has scored seven of those in his last five. Vardy also has a tremendous record against the established top-six sides. In fact, Arsenal is Vardy's favourite opponent in terms of goals scored in his career (eight). </p>
